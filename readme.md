1. Get all tracks in my Liked songs playlist, save to JSON
2. Chunk liked songs into json by year save as json year-files eg: 2020.json
3. For all files not this year, create a new playlist "likes {year}" and add songs from that year-file
4. For all files not this year, remove that song from main Likes playlist
